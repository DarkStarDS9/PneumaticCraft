Programming Puzzles are used in [link{block/programmer}]programmers [link{}].

[prefix{l}]The 'I-ftr' (Item Filter) piece [prefix{}]
The Item Filter is a piece solely used as parameter for other pieces. To start, you need at least one (but preferably two) GPS-Tools. Select a coordinate with the GPS-Tool. Then, right click the 'Area' piece, and enter the GPS-Tool's coordinate by clicking 'Select GPS 1...'. Select the GPS tool from your inventory. Repeat this for the second coordinate.

Now you've selected two points and you can create different shaped areas with these. The following is a visual representation of all of them. The Gold Blocks represent the two selected coordinates with the GPS Tool.

[prefix{l}]Filled [prefix{}]
Takes the two coordinates and creates a cuboid from them and fills it in.

[prefix{l}]Frame [prefix{}]
Takes the two coordinates and creates a cuboid from them. It takes the blocks on the edges.

[prefix{l}]Wall [prefix{}]
Takes the two coordinates and creates a cuboid from them. It fills in the sides of the cuboid.

[prefix{l}]Sphere [prefix{}]
The first coordinate is the center of the sphere. The second coordinate is one of the points laying on the outside of the sphere (thus specifying the radius).

[prefix{l}]Line [prefix{}]
A line is drawn between the first and second coordinate.

[prefix{l}]X- and Z-Wall [prefix{}]
A stair-shaped wall is drawn between the first and second coordinate.

[prefix{l}]Y-Wall [prefix{}]
A vertical wall is drawn between the first and second coordinate.
