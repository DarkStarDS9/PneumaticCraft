[prefix{l}]The 'attk' (Entity Attack) piece [prefix{}]
The Drone will attack every living creature within the area. Keep in mind that the 'Area' pieces connected to an 'I-pick' piece always will be interpreted with cuboid mode, regardless of the 'Area' piece's area mode. It's possible to create strange shapes though by using whitelisting/blacklisting of areas.

You can specify which creatures are allowed to be attacked by using 'Text' pieces as Entity Filter. So if you want the Drone to attack all players, connect a 'Text' piece to the right of the 'attk' piece containing '@player'. If you don't want to be attacked, connect up a 'Text' piece on the left containing your player name.
This follows the rules of an [link{misc/entityFilter}]entity filter[link{}].
